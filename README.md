# UnityCSProjectWatcher
Unity3D will generate a new .csproj file for the unity project whenever you add or remove classes. This will remove all custom rules previously set in the file.

This tool will listen for file changes and re-apply your custom rules.

# Work in progress
The tool already works for my simple usecase of ignoring some warnigns but is not finished yet. A better implementation for different files and rules is planned.
